        <h2>Tribal Wars Vault</h2>
        <p>
            This is the server hosting the backend for a custom Tribal Wars Vault,
            developed by myself, Tyler Camp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither I, nor this tool, are affiliated with Inno Games (the owner
            of Tribal Wars) in any way.
        </p>
        <h2>Unauthorized Access</h2>
        <p>
            All requests to this server are monitored daily and IP-logged. This
            includes spidering and port-scanning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software is in place to enforce automatic IP bans. 5 HTTP requests
            related to penetration testing will lead to an IP ban.
